FS25_REA_by_Papa_Matze - Server Installation Notes

1) Ensure the exact same ZIP file is uploaded to the dedicated server Mods folder.
   Farming Simulator checks a file hash; server and all clients must have the identical file.
2) Do NOT load a second mod that also modifies fillType weights simultaneously.
3) If weights or REA effects do not appear on clients:
   - Confirm mod is present on server and listed in server log.
   - Share server log.txt (startup) with me so I can inspect errors.
4) For further hard sync issues we can add a small network event, but first please confirm
   the server has the same mod archive uploaded.
